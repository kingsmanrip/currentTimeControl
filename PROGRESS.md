# Painter Timesheet Application Progress

This document tracks the development progress and improvements made to the Painter Timesheet Application.

## Project Timeline

### March 8, 2025 - VPS Deployment Preparation

#### Feature Removal
- Removed the weekly entry feature from the Painter Timesheet application to simplify the interface and improve usability
- Eliminated redundant UI elements and streamlined the user experience
- Changes included:
  - Removed `WeeklyTimesheetView` component import from `PainterDashboard.js`
  - Eliminated the `viewMode` state variable that toggled between daily and weekly views
  - Deleted the buttons for switching between daily and weekly views
  - Removed the conditional rendering for the weekly view in `PainterDashboard.js`
  - Fixed JSX indentation issues to ensure proper rendering

#### VPS Deployment Improvements
- Implemented critical changes to prepare the application for deployment on a Hostinger Ubuntu VPS:

1. **Static File Serving Configuration**
   - Added Express configuration to serve the React application's static files
   - Implemented a catch-all route to serve the React app for client-side routing

2. **Secure JWT Handling**
   - Removed hardcoded JWT secret fallback value
   - Added validation to ensure JWT_SECRET is defined in environment variables
   - Created a `.env.example` file as a template for production deployment

3. **API URL Configuration**
   - Modified the client's API configuration to use relative paths in production
   - Maintained full URL with port configuration for development environments

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Enhanced CORS settings to be more secure and configurable
   - Added support for configuring allowed origins through environment variables

5. **Database Backup Strategy**
   - Created a comprehensive database backup script (`backup-db.sh`)
   - Implemented features for daily backups, compression, and automatic retention policy

6. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Created a detailed deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`) with step-by-step instructions
   - Covered all aspects of deployment including server setup, environment configuration, process management, reverse proxy setup, SSL configuration, and security considerations

### Previous Improvements

#### User Interface Enhancements
- Added dashboard summary cards for quick insights
- Enhanced painter dashboard with hours summary
- Added confirmation dialog for timesheet submission
- Improved success/error messaging

#### Functionality Improvements
- Implemented timesheet editing functionality for admins
- Added auto-refresh feature for real-time data updates
- Enhanced user management security features

#### Security Enhancements
- Implemented role-based access control
- Added protection against deleting the last admin user
- Implemented authentication middleware for API routes

## Upcoming Tasks

- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Add more robust error logging for production
- Enhance input validation on all API endpoints
- Implement automated testing
- Consider migrating from SQLite to a more robust database for higher traffic scenarios

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

- The application currently uses SQLite, which may not be ideal for high-traffic production environments
- Some API endpoints could benefit from additional input validation
- Error handling could be more consistent across the application
- The application would benefit from comprehensive automated testing
